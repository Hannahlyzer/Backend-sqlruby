SELECT with JOIN practice:

Join the OrderDetails and Products tables, to show a report where the columns are OrderID, ProductName, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.

SELECT ord.OrderID, prod.ProductName, ord.Quantity FROM OrderDetails AS ord
	INNER JOIN Products AS prod ON ord.ProductID = prod.ProductID;


Join the Orders, OrderDetails, and Employees tables to return a report with with the EmployeeName, ProductID, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.  Hint: EmployeeName is not a column in the Employee table, but you can generate a
report with EmployeeName by starting your SQL this way: SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName,

SELECT (emp.FirstName || " " || emp.LastName) AS EmployeeName, det.ProductID, det.Quantity FROM Orders AS ord
    INNER JOIN OrderDetails AS det ON ord.OrderID = det.OrderID
    INNER JOIN Employees AS emp ON ord.EmployeeID = emp.EmployeeID;
